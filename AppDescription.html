The users of the Pokémon Sleep application would primarily consist of dedicated Pokémon fans eager for new Pokémon-related 
experiences and also those actively seeking ways to monitor and enhance their sleep patterns. Other users could be gamers who 
enjoy gamified experiences and are drawn to the idea of earning rewards or interacting with Pokémon characters based on their 
sleep performance. Lastly, individuals who prioritize health and wellness as part of a holistic lifestyle may find value in 
using the app to achieve better sleep. Pokémon Sleep has the potential to positively affect minority populations by promoting 
healthier sleep habits, fostering a sense of community and inclusion, celebrating cultural diversity, motivating users to 
prioritize sleep, ensuring accessibility, and removing economic barriers to wellness. Through these means, it can contribute to 
improved health and well-being within minority communities while offering an inclusive and engaging experience for all users.


The Pokémon Sleep web app offers a dynamic and interactive experience with three significant features. Firstly, users can actively 
search and filter Pokémon based on criteria like type, abilities, and more, utilizing interactive forms for a user-driven exploration.
Secondly, after logging in, users can add captured Pokémon to their collection through a comprehensive form, enabling them to 
curate and manage their Pokémon collection interactively. Lastly, the app includes a creative cooking simulator, where users can
experiment with virtual dishes by selecting ingredients from their collection, providing an engaging and imaginative way to 
interact with Snorlax and other Pokemon. These features collectively make the Pokémon Sleep app an engaging and dynamic platform,
allowing users to actively explore, collect, and experiment within the Pokémon world.

The data for this app will be generated and stored in a custom CSV file created specifically for this project.
As it's a custom dataset, there won't be a need for an external source or API. All the Pokémon and related information 
will be populated within this CSV file, and the app will read and interact with this data accordingly. Using this app, 
players can immerse themselves in the Pokémon world, actively collecting and managing Pokémon, experimenting with in-game items, 
and experiencing the joy of discovery and creativity. While our app may not have direct "business value," it addresses the
practical usage and impacts of a system by making the concept of a sleep app more interactive and entertaining for users, 
ultimately encouraging healthier sleep routines.
