Our web application aims to provide comprehensive Pokémon information and resources to Pokémon Sleep
players. The adventure takes place on a small island where players will carry out research on how Pokémon 
sleep. The player will sleep with Snorlax who is a giant Pokémon and attract other Pokémon from the island 
for a sleep study. One of the most important tasks is to increase the strength of Snorlax through berries 
and ingredients collected by helper Pokémon, thus attracting more advanced Pokémon. In that case, it is 
very important for players to learn more Pokémon information in order to better cultivate Snorlax. Also, 
we hope to give the player more guidance through some interactive features.
Collecting all the Pokémon information and choosing the appropriate helper Pokémon can be a big challenge
for players.

general advice to better cultivate Snorlax. What we try to do is to provide detailed information about
Pokémon and make specific recommendations based on the needs of players.
