        <h2>Problem Description</h2>
        <p>
            Our web application aims to provide comprehensive Pokémon information and resources to Pokémon Sleep players. The adventure takes place on a small island where players will carry out research on how Pokémon sleep. The player will sleep with Snorlax who is a giant Pokémon and attract other Pokémon from the island for a sleep study. One of the most important tasks is to increase the strength of Snorlax through berries and ingredients collected by helper Pokémon, thus attracting more advanced Pokémon. In that case, it is very important for players to learn more Pokémon information in order to better cultivate Snorlax. Also, we hope to give the player more guidance through some interactive features. Collecting all the Pokémon information and choosing the appropriate helper Pokémon can be a big challenge for players.

        <h2>Target Audience</h2>
        <p>
            The users of the Pokémon Sleep application would primarily consist of dedicated Pokémon fans eager for new Pokémon-related experiences and also those actively seeking ways to monitor and enhance their sleep patterns. Other users could be gamers who enjoy gamified experiences and are drawn to the idea of earning rewards or interacting with Pokémon characters based on their sleep performance. Lastly, individuals who prioritize health and wellness as part of a holistic lifestyle may find value in using the app to achieve better sleep. Pokémon Sleep has the potential to positively affect minority populations by promoting healthier sleep habits, fostering a sense of community and inclusion, celebrating cultural diversity, motivating users to prioritize sleep, ensuring accessibility, and removing economic barriers to wellness. Through these means, it can contribute to improved health and well-being within minority communities while offering an inclusive and engaging experience for all users.

        <h2>Proposed Features</h2>
        <p>
            The Pokémon Sleep web app offers a dynamic and interactive experience with three significant features. Firstly, users can actively search and filter Pokémon based on criteria like type, abilities, and more, utilizing interactive forms for a user-driven exploration. Secondly, after logging in, users can add captured Pokémon to their collection through a comprehensive form, enabling them to curate and manage their Pokémon collection interactively. Lastly, the app includes a creative cooking simulator, where users can experiment with virtual dishes by selecting ingredients from their collection, providing an engaging and imaginative way to interact with Snorlax and other Pokemon. These features collectively make the Pokémon Sleep app an engaging and dynamic platform, allowing users to actively explore, collect, and experiment within the Pokémon world.

        <h2>Data Source</h2>
        <p>
            The data for this app will be generated and stored in a custom CSV file created specifically for this project. As it's a custom dataset, there won't be a need for an external source or API. All the Pokémon and related information will be populated within this CSV file, and the app will read and interact with this data accordingly. Using this app, players can immerse themselves in the Pokémon world, actively collecting and managing Pokémon, experimenting with in-game items, and experiencing the joy of discovery and creativity. While our app may not have direct "business value," it addresses the practical usage and impacts of a system by making the concept of a sleep app more interactive and entertaining for users, ultimately encouraging healthier sleep routines.
